# Week15-JavaScript-APIs-and-SQLAlchemy
Create Flask API to serve the HTML and JavaScript required for dashboard page and Plotly.js to build interactive charts for dashboard.

# Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## Step 1 - Flask API

Use Flask to design an API for your dataset and to serve the HTML and JavaScript required for your dashboard page. Note: We recommend using the sqlite database file and SQLAlchemy inside of your Flask application code, but you are permitted to read the CSV data directly into Pandas DataFrames for this assignment. You will still need to output the data as JSON in the format specified in the routes below.

* First, create a template called `index.html` for your dashboard landing page. Use the Bootstrap grid system to create the structure of the dashboard page.

* Next, create Flask API.

## Step 2 - Plotly.js

Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboard.
* Finally, deploy your Flask app to Heroku.
